These tests are standalone. Any of them can be directly executed from the charm
root directory even with an already bootstraped environment.
Just like:

./tests/002-port-listening

Each one of these scripts will create the rabbitmq-single service, but if it is already
existing (in the case of already bootstrapped environment), it will re-use the existing one.

The scripts on the tests/ directory execute on the local machine and the 
ones on the "tests/scripts" sub-directory are run on the remote machine by calling internally:
juju run --unit XXX tests/scripts/0X-YYY

where:
XXX: Unit name (something like rabbitmq-single/0
0X-YYY: The name of the test on the scripts directory

To run all the tests the same way as the CI tools do, make sure there is no bootstrapped
environment with
juju destroy-environment local (optional --force)

and run:
juju test (optional -o log/ -v)
